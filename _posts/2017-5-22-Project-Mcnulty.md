title: What's your first travel destination? 
---

For my third project I tried to predict travel destinations of new AirBnB users based on demographics, like age and gender, sign up behavior, device type and web session records tracking each interaction on the platform. After playing around with different features and trying out various classification models I ran into problems like class imbalance and data leakage. Subsequently, I decided to settle on predicting if a new user is going to book or not. 

My main focus for this project was to build a functional web application where I embedded my prediction model.

In addition, I wanted to include several d3 visualizations in my web app. Here are some of the interactive visualizations I built:

A graph showing the amount of users per travel destination grouped by age.

This is a heat map showing each country and the number of users travel that travelled there.

After being half way through the boot camp I am really looking forward applying more advanced machine learning techniques in my last two projects. This weekend I started working on a NLP project which I'll finish in 2 weeks.
To be continued ...
